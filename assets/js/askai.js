var NA={billedge:{name:"Bill@Edge",hash:"billedge",color:"#E07B1F",body:`Bill@Edge is RS Software's unified bill payment platform built for banks and billers operating under the BBPS framework.

It handles real-time collection across 20+ categories — electricity, gas, water, telecom, DTH, insurance, loan repayments — with full scheme compliance out of the box. The platform is multi-channel by design: mobile app, internet banking, agent networks, ATMs, and physical PoS all supported from a single integration.

For banks it means rapid BBPS onboarding without rebuilding core systems. For billers it means a direct, certified channel to reach every payment touchpoint in the ecosystem.`,chips:["Who typically uses Bill@Edge?","Tell me about Payabbhi","What is DigitalEdge?"]},payabbhi:{name:"Payabbhi",hash:"payabbhi",color:"#B5388A",body:`Payabbhi is RS Software's end-to-end merchant payment infrastructure — everything a business needs to accept, manage, and reconcile payments across channels.

The stack covers online checkout (cards, UPI, wallets, net banking), QR code payments, in-store POS terminals, payment links, and recurring billing. It's PCI-DSS compliant with a tokenised vault, and comes with a real-time analytics dashboard so merchants can track every transaction as it happens.

It's designed for platforms and PSPs that want to move fast without compromising on compliance or reliability.`,chips:["How is Payabbhi different from Bill@Edge?","Tell me about DigitalEdge","Who is RS Software?"]},digitaledge:{name:"DigitalEdge",hash:"digitaledge",color:"#0A7C74",body:`DigitalEdge is RS Software's digital banking modernisation platform — it lets banks launch modern digital products without tearing out their existing core banking systems.

The architecture is microservices-based and cloud-native, exposing an open banking API layer that sits alongside legacy infrastructure. Banks can roll out new mobile and internet banking experiences, automate account opening and KYC, and enable third-party fintech integrations — all without a big-bang core replacement.

The result is a bank that looks and works like a digital-first institution, built on whatever core it already has.`,chips:["Tell me about IntelliEdge","How does the legacy integration work?","What is Bill@Edge?"]},intelliedge:{name:"IntelliEdge",hash:"intelliedge",color:"#6830CC",body:`IntelliEdge is RS Software's AI-native risk and analytics platform — purpose-built for payment ecosystems that need real-time intelligence on every transaction.

It applies ensemble ML models (gradient-boosted trees for structured data, deep learning for sequential patterns) to flag fraud, score AML risk, and automate regulatory reporting. Every decision is fully explainable: the platform surfaces the specific features, thresholds, and historical patterns that drove each score, so compliance teams can audit any decision without needing to trust a black box.

There are also chargeback intelligence and dispute management modules for schemes and issuers who need to automate the back-office side of risk.`,chips:["How is the AI explainable?","What products do you have?","How do I get started?"]}};function _A(i,Q){return Q.some(g=>i.includes(g))}function GM(i){const Q=i.toLowerCase().trim();if(_A(Q,["hello","hi ","hey","start","help me","what can you","greet","good morning","good afternoon"]))return{text:`Hello!

We design, build, and run mission-critical payment ecosystems — from national rails like UPI and BBPS to AI-native fraud platforms used by some of the world's largest financial institutions.

We've processed hundreds of billions of transactions and serve central banks, payment schemes, major banks, PSPs, and fintechs across India, North America, and globally.

Our four product lines (Bill@Edge, Payabbhi, DigitalEdge, IntelliEdge) are all built on that same deep payments domain knowledge — not generic fintech tooling.`,chips:["What products do you offer?","Which industries do you serve?","Talk to a human"]}:_A(Q,["who do you serve","which industri","industry","client","customers","who uses","who is it for","target"])?{text:`We work with organisations at every layer of the payment ecosystem:

**Central banks & regulators** — national infrastructure, oversight tooling, real-time monitoring

**Payment schemes** — scheme operations, settlement, participant management (UPI, BBPS, card networks)

**Banks & NBFCs** — digital banking, bill payment, compliance, fraud

**PSPs & fintechs** — merchant infrastructure, gateway, analytics

**Large enterprise billers** — utility, telecom, insurance, BBPS onboarding

If you tell me what type of organisation you are, I can give you a much more targeted answer.`,chips:["I'm a bank","I'm a fintech or PSP","I'm an enterprise biller","I'm a payment scheme"]}:_A(Q,["i'm a bank","im a bank","we are a bank","work for a bank","banking institution","commercial bank"])?{text:`For banks, the most impactful combination is typically **DigitalEdge** and **IntelliEdge**.

DigitalEdge modernises your customer-facing digital channels — mobile and internet banking, account origination, open banking APIs — without requiring a core banking replacement. It sits as a digital layer above whatever core you're running.

IntelliEdge plugs into your transaction streams to deliver real-time fraud scoring, AML monitoring, and explainable regulatory reporting.

It gives you a fully compliant, production-grade merchant payment stack — UPI, cards, wallets, QR, POS, payment links — without the years it takes to build and certify it yourself. PCI-DSS compliance and tokenisation are included.

**IntelliEdge** can layer on top to give your merchants real-time fraud scoring and chargeback intelligence, which is increasingly a competitive differentiator for payment platforms.`,links:[{label:"Payabbhi →",hash:"payabbhi",color:NA.payabbhi.color},{label:"IntelliEdge →",hash:"intelliedge",color:NA.intelliedge.color}],chips:["Is Payabbhi white-labelable?","How fast can we go live?","Talk to sales"]}:_A(Q,["i'm a biller","im a biller","enterprise biller","utility company","we bill","biller company"])?{text:`If you're an enterprise biller — utility, telecom, insurance, or financial services — **Bill@Edge** is the most direct fit.

It's BBPS-certified, which means your customers can pay through any BBPS-enabled channel (bank apps, UPI apps, physical agents, ATMs) without you needing separate integrations for each. The platform connects to your existing billing system via standard APIs and handles settlement, reconciliation, and dispute management.

We also handle the BBPS onboarding process, which can be complex — our team has done it many times.`,links:[{label:"Bill@Edge →",hash:"billedge",color:NA.billedge.color}],chips:["What categories does BBPS support?","How long does onboarding take?","Talk to our team"]}:_A(Q,["demo","talk to","contact","speak to","sales","get in touch","pricing","cost","how much","trial","get started","reach you"])?{text:`The best way to get started is to speak with one of our regional teams — they'll understand your specific context and set up a tailored demo.

You can reach us via the **Talk To Expert** dropdown in the top navigation and select your region (India, Canada, USA, or Global), or email us directly at **contact@rssoftware.com**.

Every risk score comes with a breakdown of the top contributing features — transaction velocity, counterparty history, geographic patterns, time-of-day signals — ranked by their contribution to that specific decision. Compliance officers can drill into any flagged transaction and see exactly why it was scored the way it was, with historical comparables surfaced alongside.

This matters for two reasons: regulatory audits (regulators increasingly require explainable AI in financial services), and operational trust — your risk team won't act on signals they can't understand.`,links:[{label:"Explore IntelliEdge →",hash:"intelliedge",color:NA.intelliedge.color}],chips:["What ML models are used?","Is it real-time?","How accurate is the fraud detection?"]}:_A(Q,["which","right for me","recommend","best product","which product","which one","suitable","fit"])?{text:`To give you a useful recommendation, it helps to know a bit more about your situation. A few quick questions:

1. What type of organisation are you — bank, fintech/PSP, biller, or payment scheme?
2. What's the core problem you're trying to solve — acceptance, compliance, fraud, digital channels?
3. Roughly what scale — startup, mid-market, or large enterprise?

Even a one-line answer will help me point you to the right product and the right team to talk to.`,chips:["I'm a bank","I'm a fintech or PSP","I'm an enterprise biller","Show all products"]}:{text:`That's an interesting question — let me make sure I give you a useful answer rather than a generic one.

Could you tell me a bit more about your context? For example, what type of organisation you're with and what problem you're trying to solve.
